This error occurs when using the `useCallback` hook in React Native with a function that uses a value from the component's state.  The problem arises when the state value changes, causing the callback function to be recreated, even if its dependencies haven't changed. This leads to unexpected re-renders or incorrect behavior.

```javascript
import React, { useState, useCallback } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const increment = useCallback(() => {
    setCount(count + 1); // count is implicitly captured here
  }, []); // Empty dependency array, but still recreates on state changes

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{count}</Text>
      <Button title="Increment" onPress={increment} />
    </View>
  );
}
```
