The solution is to explicitly include the `count` state variable in the dependency array of `useCallback`. This ensures that the callback is only recreated when the `count` value changes.

```javascript
import React, { useState, useCallback } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const increment = useCallback(() => {
    setCount(count + 1);
  }, [count]); // Include count in the dependency array

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{count}</Text>
      <Button title="Increment" onPress={increment} />
    </View>
  );
}
```
By including `count` in the dependency array, the `useCallback` hook now correctly tracks changes to the `count` state variable and only recreates the `increment` function when necessary.
